What is Reinforcement Learning?
Reinforcement learning, in the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning, is a method that allows an agent (for example, a robot or software) to learn by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or punishment from these interactions. Here, the agent learns to choose the right moves to achieve his or her goals.

The basic elements of reinforcement learning are as follows:

Agent 1: Our decision-making system, i.e. a robot or something similar.
2. Environment: The world or environment with which the agent interacts.
3. Actions: Movements or choices the agent can make to communicate with its environment.
4. Reward: The feedback the agent receives as a result of its actions. High rewards encourage correct actions, while low rewards or punishments help reduce wrong choices.
5. Policy: Strategy that determines what action the agent will choose.

Reinforcement learning appears in many areas, from games to robotic applications. The agent learns to perform better over time by learning from his experiences.
